jQuery AXAJ API Reinforcement
=============================

You just learned about AJAX and APIs. This assignment will reinforce what you're learned about making AJAX requests to an API. In addition, you can continue to skill up on jQuery and CSS!

As shown in lecture, make a request to the OMDb API to get a movie. Then, instead of merely logging the response, display the the movie's poster and title on the DOM! If you want, you can also display more information about the movie.

If you have extra time, use CSS to make it look fancy!
